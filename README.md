&nbsp;

<b>Soursop Leaf Extract</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Soursop leaf extract is known to possess antibacterial properties. According to research, the extract could fight various bacteria responsible for gum disease, cavities, and prostate issues. Additionally, another study indicated that soursop extracts may be effective against cholera and Staphylococcus bacteria.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stinging Nettle Leaf Extract</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, stinging nettle has been used to treat ailments such as arthritis, painful muscles and joints, gout, eczema, and anemia. Today, it is commonly utilized to address urinary issues in the initial phases of an enlarged prostate condition, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The condition results in an enlarged prostate gland, which causes various urinary problems.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Juniper Berry Extract</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier studies on Juniper extract have demonstrated its ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cells within prostate tissue. Juniperus communis contains two significant elements: essential oils and phenolic components. Among these phenolic compounds is lignan.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the most notable benefit of Juniper berry fruit is its ability to protect the prostate from infections. Additionally, it effectively minimizes hair damage and has a reputation for enhancing libido.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Leaf of Parsley</b>

&nbsp;

<b>Burdock Root Extract</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Burdock root is a potent source of antioxidants that support inflammation in the prostate glands. It aids in promoting healthier hair growth, improving digestion and skin health, and strengthening the immune system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The extract produces a medication for treating BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). This extract is derived by extracting a portion of burdock using an extractant, either an aqueous ethanol solution or water.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Goldenseal Root Extract</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The formula includes goldenseal root extract to eliminate parasites and boost testosterone levels. It also enhances urinary flow.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The effectiveness of goldenseal can be attributed to its active components, berberine and hydrastine. The two components have been the focus of numerous laboratory studies. In human experiments, Berberine has been observed to trigger cell cycle arrest in prostate and breast cancer cells.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pygeum Africanum Bark</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pygeum Africanum is among the widely recognized herbal treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies have shown that Pygeum Africanum is well-tolerated and relatively affordable than most prescribed medications for BPH.
